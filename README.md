Post-Analysis Observations and Recommendations:

Observations;

1. The brand Off-white is the most affordable brand among others. The brand mostly comes as unisex wear like hoodies and Streetwears and customers that purchased them preferred the cash on delivery mode of payment.

2. Nike brands are also affordable but a bit more expensive than some of the other brands like off-white and Adidas with a selling price of €67,975.58. The women gender bought more of this brand as it is more fanciable and they preferred the card and wallet payment mode. The product name for this brand is Nike Tech Fleece and the product types are mostly hoodies and sneakers.

3. Streetwears didn’t sell much in the year 2022 and it was mostly unisex wear and the available brands were Nike, Puma, and Adidas. The product types were caps, and joggers.

4. The casual category had lots of sales in 2022 and its major brands were Nike, Adidas and Supreme. Women bought more of it with card payment mode.

5. The women gender who were the major customers for 2022 bought mainly casual categories and brands like Nike, Puma and Adidas. They bought more of the product types like sneakers and joggers with card, cash on delivery and wallet payment mode.

6. The product type T-shirt generated very poor revenue for the business in the year 2022 and only brands like Essentials under the categories of casual and streetwear were sold and it was mostly unisex wear. The card, cash on delivery and UPI payment mode thrived more for this product type.

Post-Analysis Recommendation:

1. Seeing that the off-white brand is much affordable, lots of it can be purchased for sales in the next business year. A little price raise can as well be placed on it so it can generate more revenue for the business.

2. Nike brand is affordable in the women gender but expensive in the men and unisex gender, so it will be nice if the price is reduced minimally so that the brand can also sell more in the other genders.

3. More promo sales can be made on Streetwears to encourage customers to buy them. Other than Nike, Puma and Adidas brands, other brands can be tried to see customers’ reactions.

4. Knowing that footwear for women gender sold more in 2022, more beautiful and quality brands with nice product types and names can be purchased for sales in the next business year.

5. Wears for Unisex should be purchased in smaller quantities for the next business year as it generated very low revenue for the business..

6. The business should seize the Essential brand for the product type T-shirt and try out another brand of T-shirt with better quality and then evaluate the result.

Conclusion:
